ft::vector<int>::reverse_iterator it1 = a.begin(); this was accepted by the compiler before i did add explicit


i ve got problems when i left comparison operators inside iter that why i put them outside

main.cpp:27:23: error: invalid operands to binary expression ('ft::vector<int>::iterator' (aka 'vector_iterator<int>') and 'ft::vector<int>::const_iterator' (aka 'vector_iterator<const int>'))
    std::cout << (it2 < it) << "\n";
